GROUP 1: SECRETS
================
Sensitive credentials that must be protected. Store in Secret Manager or Configurama with encryption.

DATABASE_PASSWORD
  → PostgreSQL database password. Critical security credential.

JWT_SECRET
  → Used to sign/verify API tokens. Compromise = unauthorized API access.

COINGECKO_API_KEY
  → Paid API key for CoinGecko. Has rate limits and costs money.

SLACK_CONFIG
  → Contains webhook URLs. Can be abused to spam/phish team channels.

PAGER_DUTY_V2_CONFIG
  → Integration keys for PagerDuty alerts. Can trigger false alerts.

RPC_PROVIDER_URLS_XYZ
  → RPC endpoints with embedded API keys (e.g., Alchemy, QuickNode, Chainstack).
  → These are paid services with rate limits. Leak = bill runs up or service gets cut off.
  → Examples: RPC_PROVIDER_URLS_1, RPC_PROVIDER_URLS_10, etc. for all chains


GROUP 2: INFRASTRUCTURE
=======================
Connection strings that establish persistent connections at startup. Changing requires restart.

REDIS_HOST
  → Redis server hostname. Connection established once via new Redis() at startup.

REDIS_PORT
  → Redis server port. Part of initial connection string.

DATABASE_HOST
  → PostgreSQL server hostname. TypeORM connection pool created once at startup.

DATABASE_PORT
  → PostgreSQL server port. Part of connection pool config.

DATABASE_USER
  → PostgreSQL username. Baked into connection pool.

DATABASE_NAME
  → Which PostgreSQL database to connect to. Part of connection pool.

PORT
  → HTTP server port to listen on. Server.listen() called once at startup.

PUBSUB_GCP_PROJECT_ID
  → GCP project for Pub/Sub. Subscriber client created once at startup.

PUBSUB_CCTP_FINALIZER_TOPIC
  → Pub/Sub topic name. Subscription created once when CctpFinalizerService starts.


GROUP 3: RUNTIME CONFIG
=======================
Business logic, feature toggles, and performance tuning. Most require restart, but some can be hot-swapped.

--- Chain Configuration (restart required) ---
HUBPOOL_CHAIN
  → Chain ID for Ethereum HubPool contract. Used to instantiate HubPoolIndexer at startup.

SPOKEPOOL_CHAINS_ENABLED
  → Comma-separated chain IDs to index. Determines which SpokePoolIndexers are created.

CCTP_INDEXER_CHAIN_IDS
  → Comma-separated chain IDs for CCTP. Determines which CCTP indexers are created.

--- Feature Flags (restart required) ---
ENABLE_HUBPOOL_INDEXER
  → Toggle HubPool indexing. Checked once when AcrossIndexerManager starts.

ENABLE_BUNDLE_BUILDER
  → Toggle bundle builder service. Checked once when BundleServicesManager starts.

ENABLE_BUNDLE_INCLUDED_EVENTS_SERVICE
  → Toggle bundle events processor. Checked once when BundleServicesManager starts.

ENABLE_HOTFIX_SERVICES
  → Toggle hotfix services. Controls if HotfixServicesManager is instantiated.

ENABLE_PRICE_WORKER
  → Toggle price fetching worker. Controls if PriceWorker is instantiated.

ENABLE_CCTP_FINALIZER
  → Toggle CCTP finalizer. Checked once when CctpFinalizerServiceManager starts.

ENABLE_OFT_INDEXER
  → Toggle OFT indexing. Checked once when OFTIndexerManager starts.

--- RPC Provider Tuning (restart required) ---
PROVIDER_CACHE_NAMESPACE
  → Redis key prefix for RPC cache. Used when instantiating RetryProvider.

PROVIDER_CACHE_TTL
  → Cache TTL in seconds. Passed to RetryProvider constructor.

MAX_CONCURRENCY / NODE_MAX_CONCURRENCY
  → Max concurrent RPC calls globally. Passed to RetryProvider constructor.

NODE_MAX_CONCURRENCY_{chainId}
  → Max concurrent RPC calls per specific chain. Overrides global setting.

PCT_RPC_CALLS_LOGGED
  → Percentage of RPC calls to log (0-100). Passed to RetryProvider constructor.

NODE_PCT_RPC_CALLS_LOGGED_{chainId}
  → Percentage to log per chain. Overrides global setting.

STANDARD_TTL_BLOCK_DISTANCE
  → Blocks from head to use standard cache TTL. Used in cache key TTL calculation.

NO_TTL_BLOCK_DISTANCE
  → Blocks from head to cache forever. Old blocks are immutable.

NO_TTL_BLOCK_DISTANCE_{chainId}
  → Same per chain. Overrides global for specific chain.

NODE_QUORUM_THRESHOLD / NODE_QUORUM_{chainId}
  → How many RPC providers must agree on result. Passed to RetryProvider constructor.

RETRIES / NODE_RETRIES / NODE_RETRIES_{chainId}
  → Max retry attempts for failed RPC calls. Passed to RetryProvider constructor.

DELAY / NODE_RETRY_DELAY_{chainId}
  → Delay in seconds between retries. Passed to RetryProvider constructor.

NODE_TIMEOUT_{chainId}
  → RPC timeout in milliseconds per chain. Passed to RetryProvider constructor.

--- Service Configuration (restart required) ---
BUNDLE_EVENTS_SERVICE_DELAY_SECONDS
  → Seconds between bundle service runs. Passed to start() method, fixed in loop.

ENVIRONMENT
  → Environment name (dev/staging/prod). Used in logging/alerting context.

BOT_IDENTIFIER
  → Identifier for this instance in logs/alerts. Helps distinguish multiple deployments.

WEBHOOK_CLIENTS
  → JSON config for webhook subscribers. Parsed once at startup by WebhookFactory.

--- Hot-Swappable Performance Tuning (can change at runtime) ---
indexingDelaySeconds
  → Seconds between indexing cycles. Read from config every loop iteration in Indexer.ts.

indexingDelaySecondsOnError
  → Backoff delay when errors occur. Read from config every error in Indexer.ts.

maxBlockRangeSize
  → Max blocks to fetch per iteration. Read from config every block range calculation.

bundleEventsServiceStartBlockNumber
  → Starting block for bundle processor. Read from config every bundle query.
